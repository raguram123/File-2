<h2>Difference between HTTP 1.1 vs HTTP 2 :</h2>
<P>
    1 Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia
information systems. HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. The
first version of HTTP, referred to as HTTP/0.9, was a simple protocol for raw data transfer across the Internet.
HTTP/1.0, as defined by RFC 1945 [6], improved the protocol by allowing messages to be in the format of MIMElike messages, containing metainformation about the data transferred and modifiers on the request/response
semantics. However, HTTP/1.0 does not sufficiently take into consideration the effects of hierarchical proxies,
caching, the need for persistent connections, or virtual hosts. In addition, the proliferation of incompletelyimplemented applications calling themselves “HTTP/1.0” has necessitated a protocol version change in order for two
communicating applications to determine each other’s true capabilities.
This specification defines the protocol referred to as “HTTP/1.1”. This protocol includes more stringent
requirements than HTTP/1.0 in order to ensure reliable implementation of its features.
Practical information systems require more functionality than simple retrieval, including search, front-end update,
and annotation. HTTP allows an open-ended set of methods and headers that indicate the purpose of a request [47].
It builds on the discipline of reference provided by the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [3], as a location (URL)
[4] or name (URN) [20], for indicating the resource to which a method is to be applied. Messages are passed in a
format similar to that used by Internet mail [9] as defined by the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) [7].
HTTP is also used as a generic protocol for communication between user agents and proxies/gateways to other
Internet systems, including those supported by the SMTP [16], NNTP [13], FTP [18], Gopher [2], and WAIS [10]
protocols. In this way, HTTP allows basic hypermedia access to resources available from diverse applications.

<p>1.2 Requirements
    The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD
    NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in
    RFC 2119 [34].
    An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more of the MUST or REQUIRED level requirements
    for the protocols it implements. An implementation that satisfies all the MUST or REQUIRED level and all the
    SHOULD level requirements for its protocols is said to be “unconditionally compliant”; one that satisfies all the
    MUST level requirements but not all the SHOULD level requirements for its protocols is said to be “conditionally
    compliant"</p><br>
    <p>1.3 Terminology
        This specification uses a number of terms to refer to the roles played by participants in, and objects of, the HTTP
        communication.
        connection
        A transport layer virtual circuit established between two programs for the purpose of communication.
        message
        The basic unit of HTTP communication, consisting of a structured sequence of octets matching the syntax
        defined in section 4 and transmitted via the connection.
        request
        An HTTP request message, as defined in section 5.
        response
        An HTTP response message, as defined in section 6.
        resource
        A network data object or service that can be identified by a URI, as defined in section 3.2. Resources may be
        available in multiple representations (e.g. multiple languages, data formats, size, and resolutions) or vary in
        other ways.
        entity
        The information transferred as the payload of a request or response. An entity consists of metainformation in the
        form of entity-header fields and content in the form of an entity-body, as described in section 7.
        representation
        An entity included with a response that is subject to content negotiation, as described in section 12. There may
        exist multiple representations associated with a particular response status.
        content negotiation
        The mechanism for selecting the appropriate representation when servicing a request, as described in section 12.
        The representation of entities in any response can be negotiated (including error responses).
        variant
        A resource may have one, or more than one, representation(s) associated with it at any given instant. Each of
        these representations is termed a ‘variant.’ Use of the term ‘variant’ does not necessarily imply that the resource
        is subject to content negotiation.
        client
        A program that establishes connections for the purpose of sending requests.
        user agent
        The client which initiates a request. These are often browsers, editors, spiders (web-traversing robots), or other
        end user tools.
        server
        An application program that accepts connections in order to service requests by sending back responses. Any
        given program may be capable of being both a client and a server; our use of these terms refers only to the role
        being performed by the program for a particular connection, rather than to the program’s capabilities in general.
        Likewise, any server may act as an origin server, proxy, gateway, or tunnel, switching behavior based on the
        nature of each request.
        origin server
        The server on which a given resource resides or is to be created
        
        proxy
        An intermediary program which acts as both a server and a client for the purpose of making requests on behalf
        of other clients. Requests are serviced internally or by passing them on, with possible translation, to other
        servers. A proxy MUST implement both the client and server requirements of this specification. A “transparent
        proxy” is a proxy that does not modify the request or response beyond what is required for proxy authentication
        and identification. A “non-transparent proxy” is a proxy that modifies the request or response in order to provide
        some added service to the user agent, such as group annotation services, media type transformation, protocol
        reduction, or anonymity filtering. Except where either transparent or non-transparent behavior is explicitly
        stated, the HTTP proxy requirements apply to both types of proxies.
        gateway
        A server which acts as an intermediary for some other server. Unlike a proxy, a gateway receives requests as if it
        were the origin server for the requested resource; the requesting client may not be aware that it is
        communicating with a gateway.
        tunnel
        An intermediary program which is acting as a blind relay between two connections. Once active, a tunnel is not
        considered a party to the HTTP communication, though the tunnel may have been initiated by an HTTP request.
        The tunnel ceases to exist when both ends of the relayed connections are closed.
        cache
        A program’s local store of response messages and the subsystem that controls its message storage, retrieval, and
        deletion. A cache stores cacheable responses in order to reduce the response time and network bandwidth
        consumption on future, equivalent requests. Any client or server may include a cache, though a cache cannot be
        used by a server that is acting as a tunnel.
        cacheable
        A response is cacheable if a cache is allowed to store a copy of the response message for use in answering
        subsequent requests. The rules for determining the cacheability of HTTP responses are defined in section 13.
        Even if a resource is cacheable, there may be additional constraints on whether a cache can use the cached copy
        for a particular request.
        first-hand
        A response is first-hand if it comes directly and without unnecessary delay from the origin server, perhaps via
        one or more proxies. A response is also first-hand if its validity has just been checked directly with the origin
        server.
        explicit expiration time
        The time at which the origin server intends that an entity should no longer be returned by a cache without further
        validation.
        heuristic expiration time
        An expiration time assigned by a cache when no explicit expiration time is available.
        age
        The age of a response is the time since it was sent by, or successfully validated with, the origin server.
        freshness lifetime
        The length of time between the generation of a response and its expiration time.
        fresh
        A response is fresh if its age has not yet exceeded its freshness lifetime.
        stale
        A response is stale if its age has passed its freshness lifetime</p><br>
        <p>
            1.4 Overall Operation
            The HTTP protocol is a request/response protocol. A client sends a request to the server in the form of a request
            method, URI, and protocol version, followed by a MIME-like message containing request modifiers, client
            information, and possible body content over a connection with a server. The server responds with a status line,
            including the message’s protocol version and a success or error code, followed by a MIME-like message containing
            server information, entity metainformation, and possible entity-body content. The relationship between HTTP and
            MIME is described in appendix 19.4.
            Most HTTP communication is initiated by a user agent and consists of a request to be applied to a resource on some
            origin server. In the simplest case, this may be accomplished via a single connection (v) between the user agent (UA)
            and the origin server (O).
             request chain ------------------------>
             UA -------------------v------------------- O
             <----------------------- response chain
            A more complicated situation occurs when one or more intermediaries are present in the request/response chain.
            There are three common forms of intermediary: proxy, gateway, and tunnel. A proxy is a forwarding agent, receiving
            requests for a URI in its absolute form, rewriting all or part of the message, and forwarding the reformatted request
            toward the server identified by the URI. A gateway is a receiving agent, acting as a layer above some other server(s)
            and, if necessary, translating the requests to the underlying server’s protocol. A tunnel acts as a relay point between
            two connections without changing the messages; tunnels are used when the communication needs to pass through an
            intermediary (such as a firewall) even when the intermediary cannot understand the contents of the messages.
             request chain -------------------------------------->
             UA -----v----- A -----v----- B -----v----- C -----v----- O
             <------------------------------------- response chain
            The figure above shows three intermediaries (A, B, and C) between the user agent and origin server. A request or
            response message that travels the whole chain will pass through four separate connections. This distinction is
            important because some HTTP communication options may apply only to the connection with the nearest, nontunnel neighbor, only to the end-points of the chain, or to all connections along the chain. Although the diagram is
            linear, each participant may be engaged in multiple, simultaneous communications. For example, B may be receiving
            requests from many clients other than A, and/or forwarding requests to servers other than C, at the same time that it
            is handling A’s request.
            Any party to the communication which is not acting as a tunnel may employ an internal cache for handling requests.
            The effect of a cache is that the request/response chain is shortened if one of the participants along the chain has a
            cached response applicable to that request. The following illustrates the resulting chain if B has a cached copy of an
            earlier response from O (via C) for a request which has not been cached by UA or A.
             request chain ---------->
             UA -----v----- A -----v----- B - - - - - - C - - - - - - O
            
             <--------- response chain
             Not all responses are usefully cacheable, and some requests may contain modifiers which place special requirements
             on cache behavior. HTTP requirements for cache behavior and cacheable responses are defined in section 13.
             In fact, there are a wide variety of architectures and configurations of caches and proxies currently being
             experimented with or deployed across the World Wide Web. These systems include national hierarchies of proxy
             caches to save transoceanic bandwidth, systems that broadcast or multicast cache entries, organizations that
             distribute subsets of cached data via CD-ROM, and so on. HTTP systems are used in corporate intranets over highbandwidth links, and for access via PDAs with low-power radio links and intermittent connectivity. The goal of
             HTTP/1.1 is to support the wide diversity of configurations already deployed while introducing protocol constructs
             that meet the needs of those who build web applications that require high reliability and, failing that, at least reliable
             indications of failure.
             HTTP communication usually takes place over TCP/IP connections. The default port is TCP 80 [19], but other ports
             can be used. This does not preclude HTTP from being implemented on top of any other protocol on the Internet, or
             on other networks. HTTP only presumes a reliable transport; any protocol that provides such guarantees can be used;
             the mapping of the HTTP/1.1 request and response structures onto the transport data units of the protocol in question
             is outside the scope of this specification.
             In HTTP/1.0, most implementations used a new connection for each request/response exchange. In HTTP/1.1, a
             connection may be used for one or more request/response exchanges, although connections may be closed for a
             variety of reasons </p><br>

             <p>. HTTP/2 : Protocol Overview 
                HTTP/2 provides an optimized transport for HTTP semantics. HTTP/2 supports all of the core
                features of HTTP but aims to be more efficient than HTTP/1.1.
                HTTP/2 is a connection-oriented application-layer protocol that runs over a TCP connection
                ( ). The client is the TCP connection initiator.
                The basic protocol unit in HTTP/2 is a . Each frame type serves a different
                purpose. For example, HEADERS and DATA frames form the basis of 
                ; other frame types like SETTINGS, WINDOW_UPDATE, and PUSH_PROMISE are used
                in support of other HTTP/2 features.
                Multiplexing of requests is achieved by having each HTTP request/response exchange associated
                with its own . Streams are largely independent of each other, so a blocked or
                stalled request or response does not prevent progress on other streams.
                Effective use of multiplexing depends on flow control and prioritization. 
                 ensures that it is possible to efficiently use multiplexed streams by restricting data that is
                transmitted to what the receiver is able to handle. ensures that limited
                resources are used most effectively. This revision of HTTP/2 deprecates the priority signaling
                scheme from .
                Because HTTP fields used in a connection can contain large amounts of redundant data, frames
                that contain them are . This has especially advantageous impact upon
                request sizes in the common case, allowing many requests to be compressed into one packet.
                Finally, HTTP/2 adds a new, optional interaction mode whereby a server can 
                . This is intended to allow a server to speculatively send data to a client that the
                server anticipates the client will need, trading off some network usage against a potential latency
                gain. The server does this by synthesizing a request, which it sends as a PUSH_PROMISE frame.
                The server is then able to send a response to the synthetic request on a separate stream</p><br>
                <p>2.1. Document Organization 
                    The HTTP/2 specification is split into four parts:
                     covers how an HTTP/2 connection is initiated. 
                    The and layers describe the way HTTP/2 frames are
                    structured and formed into multiplexed streams. 
                     and definitions include details of the frame and error
                    types used in HTTP/2. 
                     and describe how HTTP
                    semantics are expressed using frames and streams. 
                    While some of the frame- and stream-layer concepts are isolated from HTTP, this specification
                    does not define a completely generic frame layer. The frame and stream layers are tailored to the
                    needs of HTTP</p><br>
                    <p>
                        2.2. Conventions and Terminology 
                        The key words " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ",
                        " ", " ", " ", and " " in this document are to be
                        interpreted as described in BCP 14 when, and only when, they appear in all
                        capitals, as shown here.
                        All numeric values are in network byte order. Values are unsigned unless otherwise indicated.
                        Literal values are provided in decimal or hexadecimal as appropriate. Hexadecimal literals are
                        prefixed with "0x" to distinguish them from decimal literals.
                        This specification describes binary formats using the conventions described in 
                        . Note that this format uses network byte order and that high-valued bits are listed
                        before low-valued bits.
                        The following terms are used:
                        The endpoint that initiates an HTTP/2 connection. Clients send HTTP requests and
                        receive HTTP responses. 
                        A transport-layer connection between two endpoints. 
                        An error that affects the entire HTTP/2 connection. 
                        Either the client or server of the connection. 
                        The smallest unit of communication within an HTTP/2 connection, consisting of a
                        header and a variable-length sequence of octets structured according to the frame type. 
                        An endpoint. When discussing a particular endpoint, "peer" refers to the endpoint that is
                        remote to the primary subject of discussion. </p><br><br>

                        <h1>Objects & its Internal Representation :</h1><br>
                        <p>Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

                            Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
                            An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
                            
                            Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
                            
                            For Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id, etc and methods like updateAddress, updateNam, etc.
                            
                            Objects and properties
                            A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:
                            
                            objectName.propertyName
                            Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and property name are case sensitive. You can define a property by assigning it a value. For example, let’s create an object named myCar and give it properties named make, model, and year as follows:
                            
                            var myCar = new Object();
                            myCar.make = 'Ford';
                            myCar.model = 'Mustang';
                            myCar.year = 1969;
                            Unassigned properties of an object are undefined (and not null).
                            
                            myCar.color; // undefined
                            Properties of JavaScript objects can also be accessed or set using a bracket notation (for more details see property accessors). Objects are sometimes called associative arrays, since each property is associated with a string value that can be used to access it. So, for example, you could access the properties of the myCar object as follows:
                            
                            myCar['make'] = 'Ford';
                            myCar['model'] = 'Mustang';
                            myCar['year'] = 1969;
                            An object property name can be any valid JavaScript string, or anything that can be converted to a string, including the empty string. However, any property name that is not a valid JavaScript identifier (for example, a property name that has a space or a hyphen, or that starts with a number) can only be accessed using the square bracket notation. This notation is also very useful when property names are to be dynamically determined (when the property name is not determined until runtime). Examples are as follows:
                            
                            // four variables are created and assigned in a single go, 
                            // separated by commas
                            var myObj = new Object(),
                                str = 'myString',
                                rand = Math.random(),
                                obj = new Object();
                            myObj.type              = 'Dot syntax';
                            myObj['date created']   = 'String with space';
                            myObj[str]              = 'String value';
                            myObj[rand]             = 'Random Number';
                            myObj[obj]              = 'Object';
                            myObj['']               = 'Even an empty string';console.log(myObj);
                            You can also access properties by using a string value that is stored in a variable:
                            
                            var propertyName = 'make';
                            myCar[propertyName] = 'Ford';propertyName = 'model';
                            myCar[propertyName] = 'Mustang';
                            You can use the bracket notation with for...in to iterate over all the enumerable properties of an object. To illustrate how this works, the following function displays the properties of the object when you pass the object and the object's name as arguments to the function:
                            
                            function showProps(obj, objName) {
                              var result = ``;
                              for (var i in obj) {
                                // obj.hasOwnProperty() is used to filter out properties from the object's prototype chain
                                if (obj.hasOwnProperty(i)) {
                                  result += `${objName}.${i} = ${obj[i]}\n`;
                                }
                              }
                              return result;
                            }
                            So, the function call showProps(myCar, "myCar") would return the following:
                            
                            myCar.make = Ford
                            myCar.model = Mustang
                            myCar.year = 1969
                            Creating Objects In JavaScript :
                            Create JavaScript Object with Object Literal
                            One of easiest way to create a javascript object is object literal, simply define the property and values inside curly braces as shown below
                            
                            let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};
                            Create JavaScript Object with Constructor
                            Constructor is nothing but a function and with help of new keyword, constructor function allows to create multiple objects of same flavor as shown below
                            
                            function Vehicle(name, maker) {
                               this.name = name;
                               this.maker = maker;
                            }
                            let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);
                            let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)
                            console.log(car1.name);    //Output: Fiesta
                            console.log(car2.name);    //Output: Santa Fe
                            Using the JavaScript Keyword new
                            The following example also creates a new JavaScript object with four properties:
                            
                            Example
                            
                            var person = new Object();
                            person.firstName = “John”;
                            person.lastName = “Doe”;
                            person.age = 50;
                            person.eyeColor = “blue”;
                            
                            Using the Object.create method
                            Objects can also be created using the Object.create() method. This method can be very useful, because it allows you to choose the prototype object for the object you want to create, without having to define a constructor function.
                            
                            // Animal properties and method encapsulation
                            var Animal = {
                              type: 'Invertebrates', // Default value of properties
                              displayType: function() {  // Method which will display type of Animal
                                console.log(this.type);
                              }
                            };
                            // Create new animal type called animal1 
                            var animal1 = Object.create(Animal);
                            animal1.displayType(); // Output:Invertebrates
                            // Create new animal type called Fishes
                            var fish = Object.create(Animal);
                            fish.type = 'Fishes';
                            fish.displayType(); 
                        //output : fish</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h2>IP address :</h2><br>
                        <p>An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.

                            In essence, IP addresses are the identifier that allows information to be sent between devices on a network: they contain location information and make devices accessible for communication. The internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers, and websites. IP addresses provide a way of doing so and form an essential part of how the internet works.</p><br>

                            <h3>PORT : </h3><br>
                            <p>Whenever any application in one computer sends data to another application of a different computer then it sends using IP Address and MAC Address but how does our computer know that this data is for a specific application and this data is sent by any specific application? There comes the concept of Port.

                                For instance, imagine your MAC Address or IP Address as the PIN code of the nearest Post Office and your house address as a Port. Whenever any parcel is sent to you it gets received by the nearest post office and then it is identified by your address where to deliver that parcel. Similarly in a computer data is first received using their IP or MAC address then it is delivered to the application whose port number is with the data packets.
                                
                                Port is a logical address of a 16-bit unsigned integer that is allotted to every application on the computer that uses the internet to send or receive data.
                                
                                Now every time any application sends any data, it is identified by the port that which the application sent that data and the data is to be transferred to the receiver application according to its port. We often call port as port number.</p><br>


                                <h4>MAC address :</h4><br>
                                <p>Stands for "Media Access Control Address."

                                    A MAC address is a hardware identification number that uniquely identifies each device on a network. Every network interface card, such as an Ethernet card or a Wi-Fi adapter, has a permanent MAC address assigned by its manufacturer; some operating systems allow an adapter's MAC address to be temporarily changed, or "spoofed," in software.
                                    
                                    Routers and other network infrastructure equipment use both IP and MAC addresses to track which devices connect to a network; an IP address represents the software connection, while a MAC address represents the hardware connection. A network administrator can configure a network to reject connections from specific MAC addresses or restrict network access to a set of approved MAC addresses.
                                    
                                    Since a MAC address uniquely identifies a particular network adapter, there must be enough unique addresses for every device that needs one. The address format uses a 48-bit identifier, formatted as six hexadecimal numbers separated by colons, that provides more than 281 trillion potential addresses. For example, an Ethernet card may have a MAC address of 00:0d:83:b1:c0:8e.</p><br>


                                    <h5>HTTP Methods :</h5><br>

                                    <p>HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.

                                        GET
                                        The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
                                        <br>
                                        HEAD
                                        The HEAD method asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body.
                                        <br>
                                        POST
                                        The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
                                        <br>
                                        PUT
                                        The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
                                        <br>
                                        DELETE
                                        The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
                                        <br>
                                        CONNECT
                                        The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
                                        <br>
                                        OPTIONS
                                        The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.
                                        <br>
                                        TRACE
                                        The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
                                        <br>
                                        PATCH
                                        The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.</p>
